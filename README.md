# Personal FxSound preset

## Preset Title: HELL YEA

This FxSound preset applies a warm, bass-forward EQ curve with a noticeably darker top end.

Adds weight and punch in the lows: A moderate boost at 62.5 Hz increases sub-bass rumble and fullness.

Tames upper-bass “boom”: A cut at 110 Hz helps reduce muddiness and keeps the low end from sounding too swollen.

Thickens the body of audio: A strong boost at 230 Hz emphasizes low-mids, making music and voices sound fuller and heavier.

Cleans up boxiness in the mids: Small cuts at 370, 650, and 1200 Hz reduce “boxy,” “honky,” or congested tones.

Adds a little presence for definition: A small boost around 2.2 kHz can bring some vocal and instrument edge back so it doesn’t become too dull.

Softens brightness and harshness: Cuts around 4.2 kHz and 10 kHz reduce bite/sibilance and sharp treble.

Strongly reduces “air” and sparkle: The large cut at 12 kHz rolls off the top end significantly, making the overall sound smoother and darker.

Overall effect: thicker lows/low-mids, less harshness, and a more relaxed high end—good for harsh headphones/speakers or long listening sessions, but it may reduce detail/“sparkle,” especially for cymbals and ambient effects.
